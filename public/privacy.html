<p>Welcome to the DW5 LLC d/b/a Snappy Gold website (https://snappy.gold or the &quot;Website&quot;). This written policy (the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this Website and certain related services. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this Website.</p>
<p>Your Consent</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the Website&#x27;s current policies and practices with respect to nonpublic personal information of the users of the Website. By using this Website, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this Website, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>At Snappy Gold, we put the needs of our customers first. Ensuring that you get an honest, upfront, hassle-free service is our highest priority. Snappy Gold offers a complimentary quote for our gold purchasing services. The information gathered for this quote is used to give you the most accurate quote possible. Personal information such as your name, address, phone number(s), email address, and driver’s license (or other government ID) is stored in our in-house database and is used for any customer care issues that may arise. Per Florida law, we also make available the description of and photos of the jewelry/gold provided, as well as the contact information of any seller on a portal accessible by law enforcement. </p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY (OTHERWISE NOTED AS THIS “AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE WEBSITES BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT ASSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.</p>
<p>At Snappy Gold, we share your concerns about privacy. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all Snappy Gold web pages.</p>
<h2>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We may collect information that identifies you, such as names, postal addresses, email addresses, telephone and driver’s license or other identification (“personal information”), when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We receive and store any information that you choose to enter through the Website, including any submissions that you make or content you provide on or through the Website or through outside social media promotions that we may sponsor.  </p>
<p>Use of Information  </p>
<p>We may use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
<p>Send you requested service information</p>
<p>Provide you with a requested service</p>
<p>Respond to customer service requests</p>
<p>Respond to your questions and concerns</p>
<p>Send you marketing communications or advertisements</p>
<p>Improve our website or services</p>
<p>Personalize your web or service experience</p>
<p>To protect against fraud, and insure confidentiality and security</p>
<p>Sharing of Information </p>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties without first providing you notice and choice.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal information to agents or service providers acting on our behalf for limited purposes. For example, we may share personal information with our agents or service providers to send you email on our behalf or to ship gold/jewelry, mailing/appraisal kits, or transmit payment. These third parties are authorized to use your personal information only to perform the service they are providing for us. </p>
<p>We may also share your information for the purposes of protecting against fraud, and insure confidentiality and security. Specifically, under Florida law, law enforcement is allowed access to our records as part of their investigation into the sale of stolen gold/jewelry. </p>
<p>Additionally, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or similar legal process served on our website) and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, and/or respond to a government request. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>In the event Snappy Gold goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. </p>
<h2>IP ADDRESS </h2>
<p>We log all connections to our web servers. Those log files include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Sites. Additionally, we will use your IP address to track your navigation of the Sites and we may use your navigation history in current and future marketing efforts to you and to others. </p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>We care about protecting the security of your personal information, and we have implemented security procedures to protect the personal information that you provide to us. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy. Some of the measures we take are:</p>
<p class="bullet">•	Limiting access to personal information to those employees who are critical to communicating with you and/or processing contributions.</p>
<p class="bullet">•	Implementing appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard against unauthorized access or use.</p>
<p class="bullet">•	Requiring appropriate consents and protections from our business partners before we share any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>While we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Moreover, where you may be required to use passwords, or other special access features on this Website, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.</p>
<p>Passive Information Collection</p>
<p>As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.</p>
<p>This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user&#x27;s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.</p>
<p>A &quot;cookie&quot; is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.</p>
<p>&quot;Session cookies&quot; are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This Website uses session cookies.</p>
<p>&quot;Persistent cookies&quot; are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., username), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses persistent cookies.</p>
<p>&quot;Internet tags&quot; (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor&#x27;s computer. This Website uses Internet tags. &quot;Navigational data&quot; (&quot;log files,&quot; &quot;server logs,&quot; and &quot;clickstream&quot; data) and &quot;Internet Tags&quot; are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This Website uses navigational data.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>This Website may contain links to websites of third parties not affiliated with Snappy Gold. This Privacy Policy will not apply to these third-party websites and the Website is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other websites, even where these third-party sites indicate a special relationship or &quot;partnership&quot; with the Website. We do not disclose personally identifiable information to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you when you link to their site. This collecting of information is not subject to the control of the Website. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of the sites you visit by linking from this Website. </p>
<p>Testimonials</p>
<p>We may display personal testimonials on our website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name and city/state of residence. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at hello@snappy.gold.</p>
<p>California Do Not Track Disclosures</p>
<p>How do we respond to Web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services?</p>
<p>We currently do not respond to DNT signals in browsers because we do not track individual users across the web.</p>
<p>May other parties collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when they visit https://snappy.gold?  </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Notice to California Residents</p>
<p>With certain exceptions, residents of the State of California may request (a) disclosure of personal information collected, (b) disclosure of personal information sold or disclosed for a business purpose, (c) deletion of personal information, (d) to opt out of the sale of personal information, and (e) access and data portability. Moreover, we will not discriminate based on your exercise of such rights. If you are a California resident and want to make any such requests, please contact us through our website (https://snappy.gold), or at Snappy Gold, Privacy Policy, 1686 S Federal Hwy #318, Delray Beach, FL 33483 or hello@snappy.gold.</p>
<p>Notice to Vermont Residents</p>
<p>In response to Vermont regulations, we automatically treat accounts with Vermont billing addresses as if you requested that we do not share your information with nonaffiliated third parties and that we limit the information we share with our affiliates. If we disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements, we will only disclose your name, address, other contact information, and information about our transaction and experiences with you.</p>
<p>Notice to Nevada Residents</p>
<p>We are providing you this notice pursuant to state law. You may be placed on our internal Do Not Call List by requesting that we cease calling you by contacting us directly and making such request in writing hello@snappy.gold.. Nevada law requires that we also provide you with the following contact information: Bureau of Consumer Protection, Office of the Nevada Attorney General, 555 E. Washington St., Suite 3900, Las Vegas, NV 89101; Phone number: 702-486-3132; e-mail: BCPHELLO@ag.state.nv.us.</p>
<p>Protecting Children’s Privacy Online</p>
<p>The Website is not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Website. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18 without parental consent. Visit the Federal Trade Commission website for more information about the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you believe that we have received information from a child or other person who is not of a majority age in their relevant jurisdiction, please contact us at our email or physical mailing address listed in the “Contact Us” section below and we will take all reasonable efforts to remove the information.</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>This privacy policy describes the types of information we currently collect, and the ways we use and protect that information. From time to time, we may collect different types of information and use that information in different ways – for example, when we add features or services to Snappy Gold. In these cases, we may edit this policy to explain the new practices. Because protecting your privacy is very important to us, we do not expect major changes in policy. However, if we do make significant changes in our practices, we will include announcements on the https://snappy.gold home page so that you will know to review the revised policy. </p>
