    <h1>General Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 24, 2026</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>At DW5 LLC d/b/a Snappy Gold (“Company”) our mission is to make cashing in on gold, silver and jewelry and watches (the “Goods”) as seamless as possible from the comfort of your home. We provide the following General Terms and Conditions to ensure your understanding of the purchase of your Goods.</p>
<p>By submitting your Goods to Company customers agree to our General Terms and Conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and Website Access and Usage.</p>
<p>Customers must be a minimum of 18 years of age to sell items through https://snappy.gold and legal owner (or legally authorized on behalf of such owner) of all the items submitted to us.</p>
<p>General steps to selling goods:</p>
<p>Contact Us. If you are interested in obtaining an offer to purchase your Goods (as a “Seller”), contact us by email at hello@snappy.gold or visit us online at https://snappy.gold and register. At that time we will provide you with the free materials needed to mail us your goods.  </p>
<p>Packaging. You are responsible for packaging your items. Should we receive damaged or open packages, we reserve the right to return the package to you without any liability therefore. No insurance claims will be processed for packages that arrive damaged. We do, however, insure the Goods properly packaged by you and received by us.</p>
<p>Sworn Statement. Before conducting a transaction, Company needs:</p>
<p>Seller’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available).</p>
<p>Seller’s driver’s license number and issuing state or other government-issued identification number.</p>
<p>A sworn statement made by the Seller that the Seller is of lawful age and that the license number, and other identifying information is true and correct.</p>
<p>The sworn statement must contain the following language: “I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.”</p>
<p>The sworn statement may be provided electronically through our website or in writing with the Goods being shipped. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If you mail us Goods without providing the required information, we will request any outstanding information from you within ten (10) days. If we do not receive the information requested within 30 days thereafter or you don’t request their return, the Seller’s Goods are deemed abandoned and are relinquished to the Division of Unclaimed Property of the Florida Department of Financial Services if the market value of the property is greater than $50. Within 24-hours of the expiration of the 30-day hold period for the Goods, we will notify the appropriate law enforcement agency of the abandonment of the property.</p>
<p>Appraisal &amp; Evaluation of Goods. Once received, your Goods shall be checked and/or tested by our trained valuation experts to ascertain their value which is primarily based on the current day values. This process may involve scratching or scraping items in order to remove the top layer of material so that the testing apparatus can accurately determine the true grade or karat of the item in question and/or placing certain acids on the precious metal or other items which can leave permanent staining and/or deep scratches. By submitting your items you are in acceptance of these terms. We will not be liable for any damage caused in this way or any resulting decrease in the value of the items. This is the only way to accurately assess the Goods’ true value.</p>
<p>Offers. After our determination of the amount of our Offer for your Goods, we will, in our sole discretion, notify you at any or all of the contact information you provided (i.e. e-mail, telephone, and text), each of which will give you the opportunity to accept or reject our offer. </p>
<p>The value that we place on Goods fluctuates with the applicable market and other factors. If our website contains general gold valuation charts, they should not be relied on for the value that we will pay and may not be continuously updated. In certain instances, we may value your item based on their resale value and in other instances we may base it on the value of melting it down or selling in pieces, taking into account the transaction costs associated with each. Generally speaking, the value of your Goods is determined by many different factors and we can only tell you how much your item[s] are worth by examining them once we receive them. We reserve the right to decline to buy any item from anyone at any time.</p>
<p>We will hold the Goods at our facility up to thirty (30) days from the date the Goods are received (the “holding period”). During the holding period you may accept or deny the offer. If you accept the offer, payment will be promptly made to you via check, or a different payment method of your choosing. If you deny the offer, we will, at no cost to you, return your Items to you. If we do not hear from you by the time the holding period expires, the offer will be deemed as accepted, payment will be made to you in the amount of the offer and the purchase shall be deemed final, binding and irrevocable.</p>
<p>Should you desire, you may call us to determine receipt of your Goods and to receive a telephonic quote for the purchase of your Goods. If you approve the quote, your items will be processed and a check mailed to you. If you do not approve our quote we shall promptly return the Goods to you.</p>
<p>Warranties and Representations.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you are over the age of eighteen years of age. We reserve the right to request documentation to verify your age. We request that you verify your age by entering your age and information on our website. The information includes the following: your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available). Furthermore, you must provide your license number or a copy of issuing state or other government-issued identification number with photo. You declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct.</p>
<p>You hereby represent and warrant that all Goods you send to us are owned by you and that no other person or entity’s permission is required to process the Goods purchased by us. You agree to indemnify and hold Snappy Gold, its officers, employees and subsidiaries, harmless from and against any claims brought by a third party claiming ownership of any items purchased from you by us.</p>
